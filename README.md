It is said that every novice programmer creates a todolist application, so I couldn't miss it too. The application was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user can add a to-do task. Later it has 3 options possible. The first is to indicate that the task has been completed. The second option is the option to edit our task if we want to change it or edit some bug. The last option is the ability to delete the task.
